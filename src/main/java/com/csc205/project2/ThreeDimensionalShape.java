I have a Java project I need your help with. We are going to generate some classes and  an interface to represent three dimensional shapes. The structure is:

- ThreeDimensionalShape will be an interface.
- Shape will be a class that implements it.
- Cube, Sphere, Cylinder , and RectangularPyramid will all extend the class shape.

Let's start with the ThreeDimensionalShape interface. It must have two methods: surfaceArea that returns a double, and volume that returns a double.

  */

public interface ThreeDimensionalShape {
    double surfaceArea();
    double volume();
}
